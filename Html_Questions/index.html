Angle brackets are used to enclose them ("<" and ">") and they often appear in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag. HTML elements beginning and finish are indicated by tags.HTML elements are made up of a combination of HTML tags and the content that goes with them.

      <h3>
        HTML tags are used to define the structure and layout of content within an HTML document. They are enclosed within angle brackets ("<" and ">") and usually come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag. Tags mark the beginning and end of HTML elements, and each tag serves a specific purpose in determining how the content within it should be rendered or behave. <br><br>

        HTML attributes provide additional information or properties to HTML elements. They are placed within the opening tag of an element and modify the element's behavior, appearance, or functionality. Attributes consist of a name and a value, separated by an equals sign ("="). Multiple attributes can be added to an element to provide different properties. <br> <br>

        Global attributes, as the name suggests, can be applied to almost any HTML element. They are not specific to a particular element and can be used across multiple elements. <br>

         Example of global attributes: <br>
<ul>
    <li><b>class:</b> Assigns one or more class names to an element for CSS and JavaScript purposes. <br></li>
     <li><b>id:</b> Provides a unique identifier to an element for targeting and manipulation. <br> </li>
     <li><b>style:</b> Applies inline CSS styles to an element. <br></li>
    <li><b> title:</b> Specifies additional information about an element, usually displayed as a tooltip. <br></li>
